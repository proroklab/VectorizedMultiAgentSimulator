Notebooks
=========

In the following you can find a list of  :colab:`null` Google Colab notebooks to help you learn how to use VMAS:

- :colab:`null` `Using a VMAS environment <https://colab.research.google.com/github/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator/blob/main/notebooks/VMAS_Use_vmas_environment.ipynb>`_. Here is a simple notebook that you can run to create, step and render any scenario in VMAS. It reproduces the ``use_vmas_env.py`` script in the ``examples`` folder
- :colab:`null` `Creating a VMAS scenario and training it in BenchMARL <https://colab.research.google.com/github/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator/blob/main/notebooks/Simulation_and_training_in_VMAS_and_BenchMARL.ipynb>`_. We will create a scenario where multiple robots with different embodiments need to navigate to their goals while avoiding each other (as well as obstacles) and train it using MAPPO and MLP/GNN policies.
- :colab:`null` `Training VMAS in BenchMARL (suggested) <https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/BenchMARL/blob/main/notebooks/run.ipynb>`_.  In this notebook, we show how to use VMAS in BenchMARL, TorchRL's MARL training library
- :colab:`null` `Training VMAS in TorchRL <https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/rl/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/a977047786179278d12b52546e1c0da8/multiagent_ppo.ipynb>`_. In this notebook, `available in the TorchRL docs <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/tutorials/multiagent_ppo.html#>`__, we show how to use any VMAS scenario in TorchRL. It will guide you through the full pipeline needed to train agents using MAPPO/IPPO.
- :colab:`null` `Training competitive VMAS MPE in TorchRL <https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/rl/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/d30bb6552cc07dec0f1da33382d3fa02/multiagent_competitive_ddpg.py>`_. In this notebook, `available in the TorchRL docs <https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/tutorials/multiagent_competitive_ddpg.html>`__, we show how to solve a Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem using MADDPG/IDDPG.
- :colab:`null` `Training VMAS in RLlib <https://colab.research.google.com/github/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator/blob/main/notebooks/VMAS_RLlib.ipynb>`_. In this notebook, we show how to use any VMAS scenario in RLlib. It reproduces the ``rllib.py`` script in the ``examples`` folder.
